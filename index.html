          Hi! My name is Danielle. I have a passion for connecting creative and technically-minded people. My love of technology and learning new things helps with this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through my work, I bring a customer-first approach to building ideas and solutions. I'm experienced in working with and managing in-house and remote teams, with a commitment to building consensus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I love watching movies, cooking and spending time with friends and family. I'm lucky enough to have family in Austin who I get to see quite regularly. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I recently completed an 8 month trip around the world with my boyfriend. I met incredible people, learned about new cultures (and food!) and even took a couple of months of Spanish classes. We visited multiple cities and countries across Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia and South America. Don't ask me to pick a favorite!
        </p>
